## Project Description

This project is a multi-page workout management system built with React
and TypeScript. The system is designed for two types of users: **coaches**
and **athletes**. Coaches can create, read, update and delete workouts for
their athletes, while athletes can view and update their assigned
workouts by ID.

As the course progresses, the application will expand from simple static
front-end into a fully integrated system. By the end of the term, the
project will function as a complete workout management platform with
persistend data, user-specific content, and production ready deployment.
